     <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.

<p>here is the positive quote</p>
<blockquote cite="https://commonslibrary.org/marshall-ganz-quotes-and-wisdom/?gclid=CjwKCAjwg-GjBhBnEiwAMUvNW-SRqlsZp99Aqwi_uNw4Qt43s4iSk0Fr8W-519Rok_wp_ZD2mfuTDxoCtfUQAvD_BwE">Organized collective action challenging the status quo—a social movement— requires leadership that goes far beyond a stereotypical charismatic public persona with whom it is often identified. <br> Unable to rely on established bureaucratic structures for coordination, evaluation, and action, such action depends on voluntary participation, <br> shared commitments, and ongoing motivation. Movements must mobilize under risky conditions not only because well-resourced oppositions often resist their efforts, <br> but also because the undertaking itself is fraught with uncertainty about how—and whether—it can happen in the first place.</blockquote>
